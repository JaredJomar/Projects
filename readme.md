# Projects

This repo contains some of my personal projects that I have created or modified for various purposes.

## ArchiveBooksDownloader

This is just a bat file that runs the archive-org-downloader.py. It saves your email, password, and sets the default image resolution so you don't need to enter it every time, just enter the book link and it will be downloaded into the Archive.org-Downloader folder.
